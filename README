Path::Class                   Perl module from CPAN	#TODO replace with File::Spec

The standard Perl modules File::Basename and File::Path (used for platform-
independent path handling) should already be present in your Perl
distribution. If not, you need to install them from CPAN as well.

If your Perl installation was not compiled with thread support, but you would
like to use FORAGE with multithreading emulation on multiprocessor platforms,
install the 'forks' module from CPAN. Alternatively, you can run FORAGE
single-threadedly, of course. 

At the moment, threads are not implemented anyway.
