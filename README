FORAGE: Find Orthologs using Reciprocity Among Genes and ESTs

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

FORAGE requires the following software packages to be installed on the system:

Package                      Download from
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
HMMer3                       http://hmmer.janelia.org
Exonerate                    http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~guy/exonerate/ 
NCBI BLAST+                  ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/
MySQL                        http://www.mysql.com

The standard Perl modules File::Spec, File::Basename, File::Path, IO::File and
IO::Dir (used for platform-independent path handling) as well as DBI and
DBD::Mysql for database handling should be present in your Perl distribution.
Update your Perl installation if not.

If your Perl installation was not compiled with thread support, but you would
like to use FORAGE with multithreading emulation on multiprocessor platforms,
you may want to install the 'forks' module from CPAN. Alternatively, you can
run FORAGE single-threadedly, of course. 

At the moment, threads are not implemented anyway.

INVOCATION

Forage allows parsing a config file, which by default is named 'forage.conf'.
Available options can be obtained using 'perldoc forage.pl'. Many options can
be set or overridden on the command line. For those switches, also see
'perldoc forage.pl'.
