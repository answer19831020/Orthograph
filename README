FORAGE: Find Orthologs using Reciprocity Among Genes and ESTs

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

FORAGE requires the following software packages to be installed on the system:

Package                      Download from
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
HMMer3                       http://hmmer.janelia.org
Exonerate                    http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~guy/exonerate/ 
MySQL                        http://www.mysql.com

The standard Perl modules File::Spec, File::Basename, File::Path, IO::File and IO::Dir (used for
platform-independent path handling) as well as DBI and DBD::Mysql for database
handling should be present in your Perl distribution. Update your Perl
installation if not.

If your Perl installation was not compiled with thread support, but you would
like to use FORAGE with multithreading emulation on multiprocessor platforms,
you may want to install the 'forks' module from CPAN. Alternatively, you can
run FORAGE single-threadedly, of course. 

At the moment, threads are not implemented anyway.
