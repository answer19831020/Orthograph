Path::Class                   Perl module from CPAN

If your Perl installation was not compiled with thread support, but you would
like to use FORAGE with multithreading emulation on multiprocessor platforms,
install the 'forks' module from CPAN. Alternatively, you can run FORAGE
single-threadedly, of course. 

At the moment, threads are not implemented anyway.
